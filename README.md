# About The Project

Gitit is a Node SPA that allows customers to order food for pickup in advance, and restaurant owners to manage said orders with the the built in system. Notifications are sent by SMS messages through the Twilio API, and the the application itself is built on Node, jQuery, Express, PostgreSQL, and SASS.

# Getting Started

1. Clone this repository onto your local device.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Set up your `.env.development` and `.env.test` files in the root of the repository with the following template:

```
REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL=
PORT=
CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=false
```

4. Start the client using the `npm run start` command.
5. Start the api server (not from this repository) using the `npm run start` command.
6. Start the api server (not from this repository) in error mode with `npm run test` command.
   <br/>

=========

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information

- username: `labber`
- password: `labber`
- database: `midterm`

3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`

- Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

7. Run the server: `npm run local`

- Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server

8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
